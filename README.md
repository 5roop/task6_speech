# TASK 6: speech to text experiments

An [example](https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-xlsr-wav2vec2) was reconstructed as an excercize. Some observations:
* A lot of workarounds were implemented to make the model work and not all of the aspects are as of yet clear to me
* Training time for 30 epochs was about 2h.

Discuss which evaluation metric to use (WER? PER?)
